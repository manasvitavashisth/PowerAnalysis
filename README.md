# Power Analysis

To validate tumor-informed variants in cfDNA, how do we establish a minimum sequencing depth (read coverage) required to achieve the statistical power necessary to distinguish a true negative from an under-sampled site?
$$
p = \text{Expected probability} = VAF_{\text{tumor}} \times \frac{\text{ctDNA Purity}}{\text{Tumor Purity}}
